                <p>I originally hail from Austin, TX, in the USA. In 2007, I moved with my family to Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada. I attended the University of British Columbia from 2008 to 2015, earning two Bachelors Degrees: one in Psychology and one in Computer Science. During the course of my studies in Computer Science, I did Co-operative Education (internships with software companies full-time). Near the end of my second degree, I moved to Mannheim, Germany. I now live in Heidelberg, Germany and I work full-lifetime with a business software company while learning German on the side.</p>

                <p>I am a big fan of video games, movies, and music in general. A combination of a desire to produce my own video game titles and an interest in directing/ special effects work in movies led me to ultimately pursue a second degree in Computer Science (although neither possibility has worked out so far - hey, I can dream, right?). I also love to travel, and I am proud to be both an American and a Canadian citizen. I hope to explore many more new places in my lifetime.</p>
